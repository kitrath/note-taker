# Note Taker

## Description
This is a simple note taking app built with [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/).  The HTML, CSS, and (client-side) JS, all found in the `/public` folder, comes entirely from starter code found [here](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/miniature-eureka).  This app uses a single flat-file as a database and grants users the ability to create, read, and delete notes.
